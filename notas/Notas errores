 Example:

    error_page 404             /404.html;
    error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;

This causes an internal redirect to the specified uri with the client request method changed to “GET” (for all methods other than “GET” and “HEAD”). 


 Furthermore, it is possible to change the response code to another using the “=response” syntax, for example:

    error_page 404 =200 /empty.gif;

If an error response is processed by a proxied server or a FastCGI/uwsgi/SCGI/gRPC server, and the server may return different response codes (e.g., 200, 302, 401 or 404), it is possible to respond with the code it returns:

    error_page 404 = /404.php;

 It is also possible to use URL redirects for error processing:

    error_page 403      http://example.com/forbidden.html;
    error_page 404 =301 http://example.com/notfound.html;

In this case, by default, the response code 302 is returned to the client. It can only be changed to one of the redirect status codes (301, 302, 303, 307, and 308).
